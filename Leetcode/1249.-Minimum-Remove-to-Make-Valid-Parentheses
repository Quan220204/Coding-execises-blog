Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters. Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if: It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

Example 1: Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)" Output: "lee(t(c)o)de" Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.

Example 2: Input: s = "a)b(c)d" Output: "ab(c)d"

Example 3: Input: s = "))((" Output: "" Explanation: An empty string is also valid.

Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 105 s[i] is either'(' , ')', or lowercase English letter.

  The idea here is quite natural that the extra ")" while traversing the string will turn into " ". To do 
  this, I convert the string to a list.After the for loop, if there is still a sign "(" in the stack, it
  means that in the string there are excess signs "(", I gradually delete these signs in the list).
  Finally I convert the list to a string.
  
  class Solution:
      def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
         S = list(s)
         stack = []
         n = len(s)
         for i in range(0, n):
             if S[i] == "(":
                stack.append(S[i])
             elif S[i] == ")":
                if stack:
                  stack.pop()
                else:
                  S[i]=""
         m=len(stack)
         for i in range(0,n):
             if m>0 and S[n-i-1]=='(':
                S[n-1-i] = ""
                 m-=1
         return "".join(S)
